# Hello, again! 

I am starting to write a second post about my last week. So what's happened there:

## lab

We did labs №9 and №10. What were they about?

Lab №9 was about Text Redactor Emacs. It's terrible redactor worse than Vim.
So many shortcuts and long start-up.

Lab №10 was about programming on language Bash. We made some scripts like (ls or dir), each argument on next line, backup sh file in archive, and type of file counter

## Programming classes

We had a lab to make a Vector class with overloading operators and some constructors and destructors.

# Conclusion

I had spent time solving labs and i had no time for myself :(

Thanks for reading
