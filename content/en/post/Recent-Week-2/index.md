# Hello again.

## I am starting to write a another post about my recent week.

### Personal Feelings

I relaxed on this week, because of early doing my homework. So I spend time watching Education Videos and listening to some music and games, of course.

### Technology Programming

We did class Vector and Matrix with overloaded operators and some functions and constructors. So in this week I am going to do System of linear equations. It's hard to write discriminant function, but i find out that we need to do recursion.
