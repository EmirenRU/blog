# Hello, World!

I am starting writting first post about how i spend my last week: May 2-8. So lets start with labs.

## Labs

Labs were not as hard as were on April 25 - May 1.

Lab â„–5 was about File Structure Analysis in UNIX-like Systems and commands to work with files and directories.

lab #6 was about Finding files, I/O redirection, Looking at running proccesses.

## Technology of Programming

Programming practical lessons were about C++ classes, how to work with them and understanding of constructions, deconstructions and differences between structure and class.   

# Thanks for your reading.

It's my first post so don't think about it so highly. Okay? :)
