In this sense, C/C++ and Python[1] can be considered scientific programming languages.\nIn a stronger sense, a scientific programming language is one that is designed and optimized for the use of mathematical formula and matrices.[2] Such languages are characterized not only by the availability of libraries performing mathematical or scientific functions, but by the syntax of the language itself.[3] For example, neither C++ nor Python have built-in matrix types or functions for matrix arithmetic (addition, multiplication etc); instead, this functionality is made available through standard libraries. Scientific programming languages in the stronger sense include ALGOL, APL, Fortran, J, Julia, Maple, MATLAB and R.[4][5]\nScientific programming languages should not be confused with scientific language in general, which refers loosely to the higher standards in precision, correctness and concision expected from practitioners of the scientific method.\nExamples Linear algebra Scientific programming languages provide facilities to work with linear algebra. For example, the following Julia program solves a system of linear equations:\nA = rand(20, 20) # A is a 20x20 matrix b = rand(20) # b is a 20-element vector x = A\\b # x is the solution to A*x = Working with large vectors and matrices is a key feature of these languages, as linear algebra lays the foundation to mathematical optimization, which in turn enables major applications such as deep learning.\nMathematical optimization In a scientific programming language, we can compute function optima with a syntax close to mathematical language. For instance, the following Julia code finds the minimum of the polynomial P(x,y) = x^2 - 3xy + 5y^2 - 7y + 3\nusing Optim P(x,y) = x^2 - 3x*y + 5y^2 - 7y + 3 z₀ = [ 0.0 0.0 ] # starting point for optimization algorithm optimize(z -\u0026gt; P(z...), z₀, Newton(); autodiff = :forward) In this example, Newton’s method for minimizing is used. Modern scientific programming languages will use automatic differentiation to compute the gradients and Hessians of the function given as input; cf. differentiable programming. Here, automatic forward differentiation has been chosen for that task. Older scientific programming languages such as the venerable Fortran would require the programmer to pass, next to the function to be optimized, a function that computes the gradient, and a function that computes the Hessian.\nWith more knowledge of the function to be minimized, more efficient algorithms can be used. For instance, convex optimization provides faster computations when the function is convex, quadratic programming provides faster computations when the function is at most quadratic in its variables, and linear programming when the function is at most linear.\n","date":1653214292,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1653214292,"objectID":"89f0f7018941b153a911391709393a5c","permalink":"/post/scientific-programming-language/","publishdate":"2022-05-22T13:11:32+03:00","relpermalink":"/post/scientific-programming-language/","section":"post","summary":"Some representation of Scientific Language","tags":["Scientific Posts"],"title":"Scientific Programming Language","type":"post"},{"authors":["Emil Samigullin"],"categories":["Post","Personal Life"],"content":"The universe is full of questions that you will never answer.

The idea is that people who are unfamiliar with the subject can find everything they need to know from a good report.\nReports make it easy to catch someone up to speed on a subject, but actually writing a report is anything but easy. So to help you understand what to do, below we present a little report of our own, all about report writing.\nWhat is a report? In technical terms, the definition of a report is pretty vague: any account, spoken or written, of the matters concerning a particular topic. This could refer to anything from a courtroom testimony to a grade schooler’s book report.\nReally, when people talk about “reports,” they’re usually referring to official documents outlining the facts of a topic, typically written by an expert on the subject or someone assigned to investigate it. There are different types of reports, explained in the next section, but they mostly fit this description.\nWhat kind of information is shared in reports? Although all facts are welcome, reports, in particular, tend to feature these types of content:\n  Details of an event or situation\n  The consequences or ongoing effect of an event or situation\n  Evaluation of statistical data or analytics\n  Interpretations from the information in the report\n  Predictions or recommendations based on the information in the report\n  How the information relates to other events or reports\n  Reports are closely related to essay writing, although there are some clear distinctions. While both rely on facts, essays add the personal opinions and arguments of the authors. Reports typically stick only to the facts, although they may include some of the author’s interpretation of these facts, most likely in the conclusion.\nMoreover, reports are heavily organized, commonly with tables of contents and copious headings and subheadings. This makes it easier for readers to scan reports for the information they’re looking for. Essays, on the other hand, are meant to be read start to finish, not browsed for specific insights.\nTypes of reports There are a few different types of reports, depending on the purpose and to whom you present your report. Here’s a quick list of the common types of reports:\n  Academic report: Tests a student’s comprehension of the subject matter, such as book reports, reports on historical events, and biographies\n  Business reports: Identifies information useful in business strategy, such as marketing reports, internal memos, SWOT analysis, and feasibility reports\n  Scientific reports: Shares research findings, such as research papers and case studies, typically in science journals\n  Reports can be further divided into categories based on how they are written. For example, a report could be formal or informal, short or long, and internal or external. In business, a vertical report shares information with people on different levels of the hierarchy (i.e., people who work above you and below you), while a lateral report is for people on the author’s same level, but in different departments.\nThere are as many types of reports as there are writing styles, but in this guide, we focus on academic reports, which tend to be formal and informational.\nWhat is the structure of a report? The structure of a report depends on the type of report and the requirements of the assignment. While reports can use their own unique structure, most follow this basic template:\n  Executive summary: Just like an abstract in an academic paper, an executive summary is a standalone section that summarizes the findings in your report so readers know what to expect. These are mostly for official reports and less so for school reports.\n  Introduction: Setting up the body of the report, your introduction explains the overall topic that you’re about to discuss, with your thesis statement and any need-to-know background information before you get into your own findings.\n  Body: The body of the report explains all your major discoveries, broken up into headings and subheadings. The body makes up the majority of the entire report; whereas the introduction and conclusion are just a few paragraphs each, the body can go on for pages.\n  Conclusion: The conclusion is where you bring together all the information in your report and come to a definitive interpretation or judgment. This is usually where the author inputs their own personal opinions or inferences.\n  If you’re familiar with how to write a research paper, you’ll notice that report writing follows the same introduction-body-conclusion structure, sometimes adding an executive summary. Reports usually have their own additional requirements as well, such as title pages and tables of content, which we explain in the next section.\nWhat should be included in a report? There are no firm requirements for what’s included in a report.

In the article we will get acquainted with its main features, show the difference from GitHub and explain why Git is for a beginner. You will also learn where to start learning and why it is not worth wasting time on alternative programs.\n#Git is a commit system\nImagine the situation: a gamer reaches the final, loses and returns to the beginning of the level — gets to the nearest control point of the game, where the developers allowed to be saved. If we remove the checkpoints, after each loss we will have to start the game again.\n In programming, the version control system is responsible for saving code at checkpoints — a special technology that can be connected to any project. The version control system insures against errors and returns the code to the state when everything worked.\n Checkpoints are called commits. A single commit is a package of changes that stores information with added, edited, or deleted code files. It is customary to add no more than ten changes to one commit — this is how a long version history turns out, which allows you to roll back in case of an error with minimal loss of workable code.\n   #Git is a complex of related branches\nCommits are located on the master branch - the main version of the project, which will turn into a product after completion.\n The version control system allows you to create branches from the master branch and experiment with the project without interfering with other team members.\n Let’s take the previous scheme, where we found an error and rolled back one commit. To fix the code, we will create several additional branches and test different solutions to the problem in each one. When a solution is found, we transfer the branch with the correct code to the master branch and save the commit. We leave or delete the extra branches, because they do not affect the project and are hidden from other developers — this is your personal draft.\n   #Git is a collaborative code creation tool\nIt often happens like this: developers separate from the master branch and work on part of the project on their own - for example, to test additional functions. But they can’t continue until someone from the team completes the code.\n The version control system allows you not to wait for the master branch to be updated and allows all team members to move freely between the branches of other developers to copy the necessary code fragments.\n There are also reverse situations when several developers simultaneously add code, upload it to the master branch and face a conflict - one file receives several inconsistent changes. In this case, Git will try to fix the errors automatically. If it doesn’t work out, the developers will see it and will be able to correct the code manually.\n   ","date":1651779893,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1651779893,"objectID":"a8aea4abfbf84886b0b9b6e63d576932","permalink":"/post/choice/","publishdate":"2022-05-05T22:44:53+03:00","relpermalink":"/post/choice/","section":"post","summary":"Development teams use a version control system.
