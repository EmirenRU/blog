In this sense, C/C++ and Python[1] can be considered scientific programming languages.\nIn a stronger sense, a scientific programming language is one that is designed and optimized for the use of mathematical formula and matrices.[2] Such languages are characterized not only by the availability of libraries performing mathematical or scientific functions, but by the syntax of the language itself.[3] For example, neither C++ nor Python have built-in matrix types or functions for matrix arithmetic (addition, multiplication etc); instead, this functionality is made available through standard libraries. Scientific programming languages in the stronger sense include ALGOL, APL, Fortran, J, Julia, Maple, MATLAB and R.[4][5]\nScientific programming languages should not be confused with scientific language in general, which refers loosely to the higher standards in precision, correctness and concision expected from practitioners of the scientific method.\nExamples Linear algebra Scientific programming languages provide facilities to work with linear algebra. For example, the following Julia program solves a system of linear equations:\nA = rand(20, 20) # A is a 20x20 matrix b = rand(20) # b is a 20-element vector x = A\\b # x is the solution to A*x = Working with large vectors and matrices is a key feature of these languages, as linear algebra lays the foundation to mathematical optimization, which in turn enables major applications such as deep learning.\nMathematical optimization In a scientific programming language, we can compute function optima with a syntax close to mathematical language. For instance, the following Julia code finds the minimum of the polynomial P(x,y) = x^2 - 3xy + 5y^2 - 7y + 3\nusing Optim P(x,y) = x^2 - 3x*y + 5y^2 - 7y + 3 z₀ = [ 0.0 0.0 ] # starting point for optimization algorithm optimize(z -\u0026gt; P(z...), z₀, Newton(); autodiff = :forward) In this example, Newton’s method for minimizing is used. Modern scientific programming languages will use automatic differentiation to compute the gradients and Hessians of the function given as input; cf. differentiable programming. Here, automatic forward differentiation has been chosen for that task. Older scientific programming languages such as the venerable Fortran would require the programmer to pass, next to the function to be optimized, a function that computes the gradient, and a function that computes the Hessian.\nWith more knowledge of the function to be minimized, more efficient algorithms can be used. For instance, convex optimization provides faster computations when the function is convex, quadratic programming provides faster computations when the function is at most quadratic in its variables, and linear programming when the function is at most linear.\n","date":1653214292,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1653214292,"objectID":"89f0f7018941b153a911391709393a5c","permalink":"https://example.com/post/scientific-programming-language/","publishdate":"2022-05-22T13:11:32+03:00","relpermalink":"/post/scientific-programming-language/","section":"post","summary":"Some representation of Scientific Language","tags":["Scientific Posts"],"title":"Scientific Programming Language","type":"post"},{"authors":["Emil Samigullin"],"categories":["Post","Personal Life"],"content":"The universe is full of questions that you will never answer.

The idea is that people who are unfamiliar with the subject can find everything they need to know from a good report.\nReports make it easy to catch someone up to speed on a subject, but actually writing a report is anything but easy. So to help you understand what to do, below we present a little report of our own, all about report writing.\nWhat is a report? In technical terms, the definition of a report is pretty vague: any account, spoken or written, of the matters concerning a particular topic. This could refer to anything from a courtroom testimony to a grade schooler’s book report.\nReally, when people talk about “reports,” they’re usually referring to official documents outlining the facts of a topic, typically written by an expert on the subject or someone assigned to investigate it. There are different types of reports, explained in the next section, but they mostly fit this description.\nWhat kind of information is shared in reports? Although all facts are welcome, reports, in particular, tend to feature these types of content:\n  Details of an event or situation\n  The consequences or ongoing effect of an event or situation\n  Evaluation of statistical data or analytics\n  Interpretations from the information in the report\n  Predictions or recommendations based on the information in the report\n  How the information relates to other events or reports\n  Reports are closely related to essay writing, although there are some clear distinctions. While both rely on facts, essays add the personal opinions and arguments of the authors. Reports typically stick only to the facts, although they may include some of the author’s interpretation of these facts, most likely in the conclusion.\nMoreover, reports are heavily organized, commonly with tables of contents and copious headings and subheadings. This makes it easier for readers to scan reports for the information they’re looking for. Essays, on the other hand, are meant to be read start to finish, not browsed for specific insights.\nTypes of reports There are a few different types of reports, depending on the purpose and to whom you present your report. Here’s a quick list of the common types of reports:\n  Academic report: Tests a student’s comprehension of the subject matter, such as book reports, reports on historical events, and biographies\n  Business reports: Identifies information useful in business strategy, such as marketing reports, internal memos, SWOT analysis, and feasibility reports\n  Scientific reports: Shares research findings, such as research papers and case studies, typically in science journals\n  Reports can be further divided into categories based on how they are written. For example, a report could be formal or informal, short or long, and internal or external. In business, a vertical report shares information with people on different levels of the hierarchy (i.e., people who work above you and below you), while a lateral report is for people on the author’s same level, but in different departments.\nThere are as many types of reports as there are writing styles, but in this guide, we focus on academic reports, which tend to be formal and informational.\nWhat is the structure of a report? The structure of a report depends on the type of report and the requirements of the assignment. While reports can use their own unique structure, most follow this basic template:\n  Executive summary: Just like an abstract in an academic paper, an executive summary is a standalone section that summarizes the findings in your report so readers know what to expect. These are mostly for official reports and less so for school reports.\n  Introduction: Setting up the body of the report, your introduction explains the overall topic that you’re about to discuss, with your thesis statement and any need-to-know background information before you get into your own findings.\n  Body: The body of the report explains all your major discoveries, broken up into headings and subheadings. The body makes up the majority of the entire report; whereas the introduction and conclusion are just a few paragraphs each, the body can go on for pages.\n  Conclusion: The conclusion is where you bring together all the information in your report and come to a definitive interpretation or judgment. This is usually where the author inputs their own personal opinions or inferences.\n  If you’re familiar with how to write a research paper, you’ll notice that report writing follows the same introduction-body-conclusion structure, sometimes adding an executive summary. Reports usually have their own additional requirements as well, such as title pages and tables of content, which we explain in the next section.\nWhat should be included in a report? There are no firm requirements for what’s included in a report.

В статье мы познакомимся с её основными возможностями, покажем отличие от GitHub и объясним, зачем Git новичку. Ещё вы узнаете, с чего начать обучение и почему не стоит тратить время на альтернативные программы.\nGit — это система коммитов Представьте ситуацию: геймер доходит до финала, проигрывает и возвращается к началу уровня — попадает в ближайшую контрольную точку игры, где разработчики разрешили сохраниться. Если мы уберём контрольные точки, после каждого проигрыша придётся начинать игру заново.\n В программировании за сохранение кода в контрольных точках отвечает система контроля версий — специальная технология, которую можно подключить к любому проекту. Система контроля версий страхует от ошибок и возвращает код в то состояние, когда всё работало.\n Контрольные точки называются коммитами. Один коммит — это пакет изменений, хранящий информацию с добавленными, отредактированными или удалёнными файлами кода. В один коммит принято добавлять не более десяти изменений — так получается длинная история версий, которая позволяет в случае ошибки откатиться с минимальной потерей работоспособного кода.\n   Git — это комплекс связанных веток Коммиты располагаются на master-ветке — основной версии проекта, которая после завершения работы превратится в продукт.\n Система контроля версий позволяет создавать ответвления от master-ветки и экспериментировать с проектом, не мешая другим участника команды.\n Возьмём предыдущую схему, где мы обнаружили ошибку и откатились на один коммит назад. Чтобы поправить код, создадим несколько дополнительных веток и в каждой протестируем разные варианты решения проблемы. Когда решение найдено, ветку с правильным кодом переносим в master-ветку и сохраняем коммит. Лишние ветки оставляем или удаляем, поскольку они не влияют на проект и скрыты от других разработчиков — это ваш личный черновик.\n   Git — это инструмент совместного создания кода Часто бывает так: разработчики отделяются от master-ветки и работают над частью проекта самостоятельно — например, чтобы протестировать дополнительные функции. Но не могут продолжить, пока кто-то из команды не допишет код.\n Система контроля версий позволяет не ждать обновления master-ветки и разрешает всем участникам команды свободно перемещаться между ветками других разработчиков для копирования нужных фрагментов кода.\n Бывают и обратные ситуации, когда несколько разработчиков одновременно дописывают код, заливают его в master-ветку и сталкиваются с конфликтом — один файл получает несколько несогласованных изменений. В этом случае Git попробует автоматически исправить ошибки. Если не получится, разработчики это увидят и смогут поправить код вручную.\n   ","date":1651779893,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1651779893,"objectID":"a8aea4abfbf84886b0b9b6e63d576932","permalink":"https://example.com/post/choice/","publishdate":"2022-05-05T22:44:53+03:00","relpermalink":"/post/choice/","section":"post","summary":"Development teams use a version control system.
